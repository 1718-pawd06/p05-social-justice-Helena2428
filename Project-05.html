         <h2>An everyday sticky situation</h2>
         <p>Everyday students wake up to their parents yelling "Sweetie you're gonna miss the bus"
            and get dressed quickly and catch the bus however, for some students they miss the bus
            on purpose just to go hang out with their friends and do harmful drugs such as Marijuana 
            and smoke e-cigs or commonly known as Juul's. As you are reading this there are probably
            many teens ditching school at the moment getting high at this moment. The NIDA (National
            Institute on Drug Abuse for Teens) states that each day nearly <b>3,200 teens and children
            each day become first time smokers</b>. That means that there life expectancy will decrease and
            they won't get to see things or live out their dreams because of these harmful
            subjects. <b>WE CAN CHANGE THIS LIFESTYLE FOR OUR CHILDREN IF WE SIMPLY DO WHAT IS SAID BELOW!</b>

         <h2>What do our children smoke and why is it so harmful</h2>
         <img class="imgrow" src="download-1.jpg" alt="download-1">
         <p>In this generation teens and kids experiment with many different types of drugs. The 
            most popular drug our children smoke is Marijuana. According to the NIH(National Institute
            On Drug Abuse) <b>"Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance.</b>" This drug is so 
            harmful for out children because it can give users un-healthy side affects such as short
            term memory loss and can harm your lungs and heart. According to the NIH (National Institute
            On Drug Abuse) <b>"This drug impairs short term memory and learning, the ability to focus,
            and coordination. It also increases heart rate, can harm the lungs, and may increase the risk
            of psychosis."</b> If you do not know what psychosis is definition.com perfectly describes what
            this word means. <b>"A mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions or 
            hallucinations, that indicate impaired contact with reality."</b> Another thing that teens
            most commonly smoke is e-cigs or most commonly known as Juul's. A Juul is a new e-cig that
            many young teens and adults are smoking. Juul's cost around <b>$35.99 per each Juul</b>. 
            Many teens are getting these from there older siblings who will buy these Juul's for them or there 
            parents who simply think that a Juul is healthy for there teen. However, smoking a Juul is
            <b>not all that cool.</b> A Juul contains the same harmful ingredients as regular cigarettes do and
            causes the same effects as cigarettes do. These are addicting for kids and they even bring 
            them to school. Some kids excuse themselves during class to use the restroom but they are
            going to the bathroom just to Juul or some even do it right in class when the teacher is not
            looking. Many students in this era are getting caught for doing Juul during school hours. 
            Meg Kenny assistant head of Burr and Burton Academy in Manchester Vermont says that <b>"Nighty-five percent of 
            the disciplinary infractions we dealt with in the fall and continue to deal with into the spring 
            are all connected to the Juul."</b>
         <h2>How can you help your children or someone you know that is struggling with these 
            addictions
         </h2>
         <img class="bottomimg" src="180209170151-marley-natural-marijuana-780x439.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="180209171-marley-natural-marijuana-780x439">
         <p>You can help people with these addictions by helping them find the help they need in order to quit 
            drugs. There are hundreds of organizations that can help you quit just a call away. You can also be
            prescribed drugs that can help you with these addictions. However, do not try to solve these problems
            yourself, it can be difficult to solve these problems on your own. It is recommended by "Drugabuse.com"
            that <b>"when you have a child struggling with substance abuse, attempting to handle it on your own can be
            extremely overwhelming and can eventually become your first and only priority."</b> There are also therapists
            that can help your child or a loved one that can help them overcome there addictions. You must also watch
            if you have older children or they have older friends that can purchase these drugs for them. If
            your child does have older friends or older brothers/sisters the best thing to do is to watch
            them carefully and check your child's room for any drugs or Juul's that may be laying around. If
            you do find drugs confront your child calmly not in a rude manner. Being rude about this will 
            only scare them and they may run out and find more drugs and get high again. You can help your
            child or a loved one, do not let drugs control them!
